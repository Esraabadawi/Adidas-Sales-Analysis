# Adidas-Sales-Analysis

## Overview
This project is an analysis of **Adidas sales data from 2020 to 2021** using **Power BI**.  
I wanted to understand how sales and profits changed across regions, retailers, and sales methods, and to find out which products and channels performed best.  

The dashboard gives an easy and interactive way to explore total sales, profit, units sold, and monthly performance trends.
